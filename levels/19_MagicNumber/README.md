# MagicNumber

The files in this directory provide the solution to the "MagicNumber" level.

## Solution
See https://medium.com/coinmonks/ethernaut-lvl-19-magicnumber-walkthrough-how-to-deploy-contracts-using-raw-assembly-opcodes-c50edb0f71a2 for a better explaination than what I can give.

## Running the Script
```{bash}
npx hardhat run scripts/hack.js --network rinkeby
```

## Testing
To test the solution, the `scripts/hack.js` script can be run on a fork of the Rinkeby testnet:
```{bash}
npx hardhat run scripts/hack.js --network hardhat
```
